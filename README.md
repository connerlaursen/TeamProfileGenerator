Team Profile Generator

    

## Description 

It generates a team card on an html page, and tests the functions using jest.

Inquirer prompts you to answer questions in the terminal about your team such as their email, id number and name. Engineers exclusively have a Github username, interns exclusively have a school and managers exclusively have an office number.

You can add as many employees as you want.

Once the questions are answered, an HTML page is rendered using the answers to the questions.
